1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Silence
Oh, I remember the silence

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,500
On a cold winter day
After many months on the battlefield

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we were used to the violence
Then all the cannons went silent

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And the snow fell
Voices sang to me from no man's land

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,300
We are all
We are all
We are all
We are all friends!

6
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,440
And today we're all brothers
Tonight we're all friends

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,360
A moment of peace in a war that never ends

8
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,280
Today we're all brothers
We drink and unite

9
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Now Christmas has arrived and the snow turns the ground white

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,360
Hear carols from the trenches
We sing O Holy Night

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,360
Our guns laid to rest among snowflakes

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,480
A Christmas in the trenches
A Christmas on the front far from home

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:34,080
Madness
Oh, I remember the sadness

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,440
We were hiding our tears
In a foreign land where we faced our fears

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:49,320
We were soldiers
Carried the war on our shoulders

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:58,780
For our nations
Is that why we bury our friends?

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,500
We were all
We were all
We were all
We were all friends

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,380
And today we're all brothers
Tonight we're all friends

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,380
A moment of peace in a war that never ends

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,980
Today we're all brothers
We drink and unite

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,720
Now Christmas has arrived and the snow turns the ground white

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,600
Hear carols from the trenches
We sing O Holy Night

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
Our guns laid to rest among snowflakes

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,800
A Christmas in the trenches
A Christmas on the front far from home

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,960
We were all
We were all
We were all
We were all friends

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,360
And today we're all brothers
Tonight we're all friends

27
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,320
A moment of peace in a war that never ends

28
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,680
Today we're all brothers
We drink and unite

29
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,000
Now Christmas has arrived and the snow turns the ground white

30
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,360
A Christmas on the frontline
We walk among our friends

31
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,120
We don't think about tomorrow
The battle will commence

32
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,240
When we celebrated Christmas
We thought about our friends

33
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,960
Those who never made it home
When the battle had commenced
